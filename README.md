# target_practice
A pygame where you control a toy gun that shoots (3 bullets max) at a target--once hit it speeds up.

With all the files downloaded in a folder and with python and pygame installed on your system you can run target_practice.py.

You can control the gun with up/down keys or W/S and you can shoot bullets with space bar. You have 3 bullets to hit the target with. If you hit it your bullets are reloaded and the target speeds up.
